            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>230 g frozen crispy chicken cutlets</li>
                <li>Cooking spray</li>
                <li>2.5 cups frozen bite-sized potato nuggets</li>
                <li>2 ounces Parmesan cheese, freshly grated with a 
                    Microplane, divided, plus more for garnish 
                    (about 1 cup)</li>
                <li>1 cup Caesar dressing</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon anchovy paste</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>4 cups finely chopped Romaine lettuce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees C. Set 2 shelves 
                    near the center of the oven. Spray a baking pan 
                    with cooking spray; place frozen chicken filets 
                    on the pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the lower-center 
                    shelf until hot and crisp, about 20 minutes, 
                    turning filets over halfway through heating 
                    time. When cool enough to handle, cut filets 
                    into bite-sized pieces.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, line a large rimmed baking sheet 
                    with parchment paper, and add tater tots in 
                    an even layer.</li>
                <li>Bake on upper-center shelf in the preheated 
                    oven until tots are soft and slightly baked, 
                    8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Spray 
                    cooking spray on the bottom of a cup. Smash 
                    each tater tot into a flat disk with cup. </li>
                <li>Return to the oven; bake until golden brown 
                    and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from 
                    oven again, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup 
                    Parmesan cheese. </li>
                <li>Bake again until cheese is melted, about 
                    1 minute. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, whisk Caesar dressing, lemon juice, 
                    anchovy paste, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 
                    and salt together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
                <li>Toss together lettuce, chicken, remaining 1/2 cup 
                    Parmesan cheese and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black 
                    pepper until well combined. Pour half the dressing 
                    into salad mix and toss until evenly coated. Add 
                    cooled tater tots and toss until well combined.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a serving platter, drizzle with white 
                    balsamic vinegar, and garnish with more Parmesan 
                    cheese. Serve immediately.</li>
