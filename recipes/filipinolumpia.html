        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My stepmother is Filipino. I would watch her make these on 
            special occasions. She never measured what she did, but I 
            think I've got the knack of it. This is one of the best 
            Filipino foods next to pancit - and unfortunately, I don't 
            know how to make that!! You can find lumpia wrappers in 
            Asian food stores wherever they keep their frozen food, 
            and also (if you're lucky) in very large supermarkets.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 package (340 g) lumpia wrappers</li>
                <li>450 g ground beef</li>
                <li>½ 225 g ground pork</li>
                <li>⅓ cup finely chopped onion</li>
                <li>⅓ cup finely chopped green bell pepper</li>
                <li>⅓ cup finely chopped carrot</li>
                <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure the lumpia wrappers are completely 
                    thawed. Lay several out on a clean dry surface 
                    and cover with a damp towel. The wrappers are 
                    very thin and the edges will dry out quickly.
                </li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, blend together the ground beef 
                    and pork, onion, green pepper and carrot. Place 
                    about 2 tablespoons of the meat mixture along the 
                    center of the wrapper. The filling should be no 
                    bigger around than your thumb or the wrapper will 
                    burn before the meat is cooked. Fold one edge of 
                    the wrapper over to the other. Fold the outer edges
                     in slightly, then continue to roll into a 
                     cylinder. Wet your finger, and moisten the edge to
                      seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and 
                      filling, keeping finished lumpias covered to 
                      prevent drying. This is a good time to recruit 
                      a friend or loved one to make the job less 
                      repetitive!
                </li>
                <li>Heat oil in a 23 cm skillet at medium to medium 
                    high heat until oil is 170 to 175 degrees C. Fry
                     3-4 lumpia at a time. It should only take about 
                     2-3 minutes for each side. The lumpia will be 
                     nicely browned when done. Drain on paper towels.
                </li>
                <li>You can cut each lumpia into thirds for parties, 
                    if you like. In the Philippines, lumpia was eaten 
                    with banana ketchup, but I've never seen it sold 
                    in America.
