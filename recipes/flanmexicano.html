        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Mexican flan recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law, 
            who is from Durango, Mexico. I had to beg her for years to 
            give me this custard recipe — she finally gave it to me one 
            Christmas. I added orange zest, but the original dessert 
            recipe calls for just pure vanilla. You can also use 
            almond extract.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 can (400 g) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated orange peel</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sugar into a heavy saucepan over medium-high 
                    heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar melts 
                    and turns a golden amber color, about 10 minutes. 
                    Watch carefully once syrup begins to change color 
                    because it burns quickly. Carefully pour caramel 
                    syrup into a flan mold. Set aside to cool.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C. Place an oven 
                    rack in the middle position.
            </li>
            <li>Place sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, eggs, 
                    egg yolks, orange juice, orange peel, vanilla, 
                    and cornstarch into a blender; blend until smooth, 
                    about 1 minute. Pour in cream and pulse several 
                    times to incorporate. Pour mixture over cooled 
                    caramel syrup in the flan mold.
            </li>
            <li>Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel. 
                    Place the filled flan mold carefully on the towel 
                    in the roasting pan, then place the roasting pan 
                    on the oven rack. Fill the roasting pan with enough 
                    boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the 
                    flan mold.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center of flan 
                    is set but still slightly jiggles when nudged, 45 
                    minutes to 1 hour. Let cool, then refrigerate for 
                    at least 4 hours.
            </li>
            <li>To serve, run a sharp paring knife around the inside 
                    of the mold to release flan. Place a serving plate 
                    on the mold, then flip the mold over. Gently lift 
                    the mold to release flan and allow caramel syrup 
                    to cascade over custard. Remove the mold.
            </li>
        </ol>
