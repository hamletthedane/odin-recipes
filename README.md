# odin-recipes
This repository is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s Foundation course. 

More specifically, it is an exercise in creating static web pages using basic features of HTML. 

This repository, which was published online via Github Pages, consists of a main page, called `index.html`, that links to three other webpages with recipes taken from [All Recipes](https://www.allrecipes.com).
